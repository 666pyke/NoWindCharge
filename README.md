# NoWindCharge - Restrict WindCharge Usage! üå¨Ô∏è
## Overview
**NoWindCharge** is a Minecraft plugin designed to restrict the usage and effects of the Wind Charge item in your server.

# Features
**Complete Disable Option**: Option to completely disable Wind Charge usage and explosions server-wide.
**Region-Based Restrictions**: Prevent players from using Wind Charge or triggering its explosions in specific WorldGuard regions.
**Custom Message**s: Fully configurable messages to notify players when their action is blocked.
**Bypass Permissions**: Allow admins or specific players to bypass restrictions.
